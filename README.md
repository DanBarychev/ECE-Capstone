# ECE_Capstone

Daniel Barychev's, Luca Amblard's, and Hana Frluckaj's 18-500 ECE Capstone Project at Carnegie Mellon

Our project aimed to simulate a catch process with a robotic dog via a motion tracking glove and an omniwheel chassis. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 constraints, building the chassis became impossible and we were forced to simulate the process. See Final_Report.pdf for more details.
